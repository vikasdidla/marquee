     <h1 id="Resturant">About Resturent</h1><a href="#Resturant">up</a>
     <p>KFC Corporation,[4] doing business as KFC (also commonly referred to by its historical name Kentucky Fried Chicken), is an American fast food restaurant chain that specializes in fried chicken.
      Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, it is the world's second-largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales) after McDonald's, with over 30,000 locations globally in 150 countries as of April 2024.</p>
      <p>[5] The chain is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains.[6]
      KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders (1890â€“1980), an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression.
      Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant-franchising concept, and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise opened in South Salt Lake, Utah, in 1952. </p>
      <p>KFC popularized chicken in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger. By branding himself as "Colonel Sanders", Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising to this day.
       However, the company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders, and he sold it to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey in 1964.</p>

    <p></p>KFC is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, one of the largest restaurant companies in the world. KFC had sales of $23 billion in 2013.[1] KFC is incorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law,[2] and has its headquarters at 1441 Gardiner Lane, Louisville, Kentucky, in a three-story colonial style building known colloquially as the "White House" due to its resemblance to the US president's home.</p>
    <p>The headquarters contain executive offices and the company's research and development facilities.[5]
    <p>By December 2013, there were 18,875 KFC outlets in 118 countries and territories around the world.[6] There are 4,563 outlets in China, 4,491 in the United States and 9,821 across the rest of the world.[6] Outlets are owned by franchisees or directly by the company.[7] Eleven percent of outlets are company owned, with the rest operated by franchise holders.[8] Although capital intensive, company ownership allows for faster expansion of the chain.[9]</p>
     <p>Most restaurants are furnished with images of the company founder, Colonel Harland Sanders.[5] As well as dine-in and take-out, many stand-alone KFC outlets offer a drive-through option.[10] KFC offers a limited delivery service in a small number of markets.[10] Units include express concessions and kiosks which feature a limited menu and operate in non-traditional locations such as filling stations, convenience stores, stadia, theme parks and colleges, where a full scale outlet would not be practical.[10] Average annual sales per unit was $1.2 million in 2013.[11] Worldwide, the daily average number of food orders at an outlet is 250, with most occurring within a two-hour peak period.</p>
